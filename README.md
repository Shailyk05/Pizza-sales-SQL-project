# Pizza Sales SQL Project

This project involves the analysis of a pizza sales dataset using SQL. The dataset is divided into four CSV files: Orders, Order_Details, Pizzas, and Pizza_Types.

Methodology :--
Data Collection: SQL queries on sales database.
Data Analysis: Price comparison, order frequency, category analysis.
Tools Used: SQL.

üîç Key Highlights from My Analysis:
üçï The Greek Pizza holds the title for the highest priced pizza. 
üçï The Thai Chicken Pizza, the Classic Deluxe Pizza, and the Italian Supreme Pizza are our top crowd-pleasers, dominating the order charts. 
üçï Pizza offerings are delightfully diverse, categorized into Classic, Supreme, Chicken, and Veggie options, catering to every taste bud out there.

Learning Outcomes:--
Skills Enhanced: Data analysis, data visualization, business intelligence.
